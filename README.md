# 👷‍♂️🏢 JobIn - Job searching and learning for Informal Workers

JobIn  is a web platform for informal workers looking to find jobs and learning new skills. The platform is built to address the challenges in Indonesia, where there is no digital job platform like LinkedIn that caters specifically to the needs of low-income, rural communities. With the help of an advanced *AI voice assistant*, JobIn makes it easy for those with limited digital literacy to navigate the site. It also works well with *low internet connectivity*, ensuring accessibility for users in areas with limited resources.

## Overview

With JobIn you can:
- Browse and apply to available jobs around you
- Enroll in provided skill classes to improve your qualifications
- Use a built-in voicebot to navigate and complete tasks more easily (accessibility‑focused)

## Tech Stack

- Next.js + React — App framework, routing, SSR/SSG, UI
- TypeScript — Type‑safe application code
- Firebase — App platform (Auth, database/storage as configured)
- Firebase Auth — Authentication for users
- Cloudinary — Media management and image delivery
- Vercel — Hosting and CI/CD for the Next.js app
- CSS — Styling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Next.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- A package manager: npm (bundled with Next), pnpm, or Yarn
- A Firebase project (for Auth and other services you use)
- A Cloudinary account (for media)

### Installation

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/medlynhan/JobIn.git
cd JobIn

# Install dependencies (pick one)
npm install
# or
pnpm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your values. Common examples:

```bash
# Firebase (client-side keys must be NEXT_PUBLIC_ to be exposed to the browser)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Cloudinary
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

Notes:
- In Next.js, variables available to the browser must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.
- Do not expose server-only secrets (like `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`) to the client.

### Run in Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

- App runs at http://localhost:3000
- You may be prompted by the browser to allow microphone access (voicebot) and location access (nearby jobs).

### Build and Run in Production

```sh
# Create an optimized production build
npm run build

# Start the production server
npm start
```

Ensure all required environment variables are set on your host before starting.

## Accessibility

- Voicebot: The app includes a voice assistant designed to help blind and low‑vision users navigate and perform key actions.
  - Requires microphone permission in the browser.
  - Look for an on‑screen toggle or settings entry to enable it.

## Deployment (Vercel)

1. Push your repository to GitHub.
2. In [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), click “New Project” and import the repository.
3. Framework preset: Next.js (auto-detected).
4. Add the same environment variables from `.env.local` to the Vercel project settings.
5. Deploy. Vercel will build and host the app, and automatically redeploy on new commits.
